# ðŸ”Œ **Running on a SLURM cluster**

_This documentation is a work in progress._

OmniGibson can be run on a SLURM cluster using the _enroot_ container software, which is a replacement
for Docker that allows containers to be run as the current user rather than as root. _enroot_ needs
to be installed on your SLURM cluster by an administrator.

With enroot installed, you can follow the below steps to run OmniGibson on SLURM: 

1. Download the dataset to a location that is accessible by cluster nodes. To do this, you can use
the download_dataset.py script inside OmniGibson's scripts directory, and move it to the right spot
later. In the below example, /cvgl/ is a networked drive that is accessible by the cluster nodes.
**For Stanford users, this step is already done for SVL and Viscam nodes**
```{.shell .annotate}
OMNIGIBSON_NO_OMNIVERSE=1 python scripts/download_dataset.py
mv omnigibson/data /cvgl/group/Gibson/og-data-0-2-1
```

2. (Optional) Distribute the dataset to the individual nodes.
This will make load times much better than reading from a network drive.
To do this, run the below command on your SLURM head node (replace `svl` with your partition
name and `cvgl` with your account name, as well as the paths with the respective network
and local paths). Confirm via `squeue -u $USER` that all jobs have finished. **This step is already done for SVL and Viscam nodes**
```{.shell .annotate}
sinfo -p svl -o "%N,%n" -h | \
  sed s/,.*//g | \
  xargs -L1 -I{} \
    sbatch \
      --account=cvgl --partition=svl --nodelist={} --mem=8G --cpus-per-task=4 \
      --wrap 'cp -R /cvgl/group/Gibson/og-data-0-2-1 /scr-ssd/og-data-0-2-1'
```

3. Download your desired image to a location that is accessible by the cluster nodes. (Replace the path with your own path, and feel free to replace `latest` with your desired branch tag). You have the option to mount code (meaning you don't need the container to come with all the code you want to run, just the right dependencies / environment setup)
```{.shell .annotate}
enroot import --output /cvgl2/u/cgokmen/omnigibson.sqsh docker://stanfordvl/omnigibson:action-primitives
```

4. (Optional) If you intend to mount code onto the container, make it available at a location that is accessible by the cluster nodes. You can mount arbitrary code, and you can also mount a custom version of OmniGibson (for the latter, you need to make sure you mount your copy of OmniGibson at /omnigibson-src inside the container). For example:
```{.shell .annotate}
git clone https://github.com/StanfordVL/OmniGibson.git /cvgl2/u/cgokmen/OmniGibson
```

5. Create your launch script. You can start with a copy of the script below. If you want to launch multiple workers, increase the job array option. You should keep the setting at at least 1 GPU per node, but can feel free to edit other settings. You can mount any additional code as you'd like, and you can change the entrypoint such that the container runs your mounted code upon launch. See the mounts section for an example. A copy of this script can be found in docker/sbatch_example.sh
```{.shell .annotate}
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#SBATCH --account=cvgl

6. Launch your job using `sbatch your_script.sh` - and profit!
